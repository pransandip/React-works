  "word_vec1": "Here's to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the troublemakers The round pegs in the square holes The ones who see things differently They're not fond of rules And they have no respect for the status quo You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.",
  "word_vec2": "I believe that everything happens for a reason people change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.",
  "word_vec3": "To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless will change. It will not be broken To love is to be vulnerable."
